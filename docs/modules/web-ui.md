# Web UI

SEC-017 shows pending Runtime permissions only to the Device owner's full Web
session in the selected Team and Room membership. A new request opens a dialog
with the exact operation and **Allow once / Deny** controls; closing is not a
decision. A pending control reopens it and the sidebar includes its count.
Disconnected or submitting controls cannot approve. Agent details mirror the
local Central approval revision without changing their filesystem access label.
See [SEC-017 evidence](../acceptance/sec-017-central-runtime-approval.md).

The Room composer uses one compact Task row, a content-sized input and concise
draft feedback. Room policy switches remain in Room settings; selected recipients
and routing blockers stay visible when relevant. The workspace sidebar can be
collapsed from the header, with a browser-local preference. Agent replies offer
exact Markdown copy on hover or keyboard focus; touch devices expose the action
without hover. See [WEB-079 evidence](../acceptance/web-079-compact-conversation.md).

[ADR-0062](../adr/0062-trust-owner-devices-for-central-execution.md) adds an
owner-local full-trust choice for Codex execution, mirrored to Central and pinned
per Run. Default-off consent, local revocation, pairing/revision checks and
ordinary task authority remain mandatory.

Agent details display the device's mirrored full-trust status, revision and
client revocation location. Central does not provide a control to enable owner
consent remotely. Ordinary Room conversation remains the single request entry;
local full trust is the primary owner choice and range policies are collapsed.
See [SEC-016 evidence](../acceptance/sec-016-device-execution-trust.md).

[ADR-0036](../adr/0036-add-governed-software-team-execution.md) extends Work with
plan proposal/edit/approval, dependencies and input pins, verification,
integration and recovery surfaces. Existing Task/Run/Result details remain the
canonical views. Plan approval, local authority, Result acceptance and merge
approval are separate actions with exact version/candidate receipts. New flows
require real Server-backed and responsive browser acceptance before completion.

[ADR-0039](../adr/0039-keep-repositories-client-owned.md) keeps repository and
Git authority on Client/Bridge. Remote Evidence presentation is a retained
Optional Extension, not a Core completion gate; the browser never receives Git
credentials or repository execution authority.

## Scope

- Prefix: `WEB`
- Planned location: `apps/web/`
- Owns: browser presentation state and user interaction

The browser client is the primary Team conversation surface. It renders
authoritative server state and sends user intents; it does not contain routing,
authorization, or Run state-machine logic.

`WEB-063` adds a Plan tab to the canonical Task detail. The Server owns the
Task-scoped plan list, revision history, exact digest and immutable review
history. The browser may render a structural diff and edit one complete draft
definition, but every revision and approval remains a closed Server command.
Approval is an explicit human action bound to the selected revision, digest and
current root Task revision; a browser role label or cached projection is never
authority. Exact response-loss recovery retains command pins only and never
stores credentials, definitions, source evidence or repository bytes. The
frozen boundary and acceptance matrix live in
[`WEB-063`](../acceptance/web-063-plan-control-surface.md).

`WEB-063` is accepted. The retained product fixture and production browser
prove exact revision-2 identity, graph/policy inspection, adjacent diff,
owner-only revision/review controls, response-loss recovery and immutable
receipt presentation without submitting a review. At 1280, 720 and 390 pixels
the document and Plan surface remain horizontally bounded; the Task tab strip
retains a 38-pixel visible row under the scrolling detail grid, including the
English light-theme view. The complete command, test, physical cleanup and
screenshot evidence remains in the acceptance record rather than a second
delivery checklist.

`WEB-064` is accepted. Its
[proof-control acceptance](../acceptance/web-064-proof-control-surface-goal.md)
adds one authorized Evidence tab that presents local and remote
SourceEvidence, verification/CI proof, explicit adoption, integration
approval/receipt and closed recovery guidance for every current node. The
Server owns the projection and next-action code. The browser submits only an
unchanged Server-prepared remote-adoption or integration-approval template
after explicit confirmation; unknown submissions retain exact command pins
and require authoritative lookup before retry. Production-browser evidence at
1280, 720 and 390 pixels covers local integration, remote adoption and unknown-
outcome recovery without exposing credentials, local paths or grants. The
surface never runs verification or Git and cannot open an incoming edge for a
remote producer.

The remote source, CI proof and remote-adoption states above remain available
only when the Optional Remote Evidence Extension is configured. Default
installation exposes no provider credential and initiates no provider access.
New provider adapters, PR/webhook lifecycle, push, remote merge and provider
credential controls are paused unless separately re-approved.

`WEB-065` is accepted as the bounded-autonomy productization tail. It extends the existing
Plan tab with current-versus-candidate supersession diff, a Server-prepared
mandatory carry set, exact human activation and one-shot Tech Lead delegation
issue/status/revoke controls. It also extends the Room composer with explicit
focused-participation/read-only-quorum settings and the expanded Discussion
view with immutable selection, seal and supplemental-evidence audit facts. The
[accepted record](../acceptance/web-065-bounded-autonomy-surface.md) keeps every
digest, eligibility decision and mutation on the existing Server authority;
the browser neither computes evidence reuse nor acts as an Agent.

Presentation is split under `apps/web/src/features/` by product responsibility:
Auth owns the access gate, Team owns member and lifecycle surfaces, Room owns
the timeline and Room settings, Agent owns roster and configuration, Device owns
Device inventory and pairing presentation,
Bridge owns enrollment controls, Run owns activity and diagnostic presentation,
Discussion owns Wave status and controls, and Task owns selection, creation, and
clarification surfaces. Shared HTTP behavior lives in `api-client.ts`, while
browser projection types live in `models.ts`. The Room composer owns its draft,
Mention selection, outbox retry, and multi-Agent submission state through
`useRoomComposer`; Discussion selection, goal editing, and lifecycle commands
are isolated in `useDiscussionController`. `useWebSession` owns synchronous
session authority and expiry; `useRoomSynchronization` owns Room lifetimes,
snapshots, deltas, backward history and listener cleanup. `App.tsx` coordinates
their authoritative projections and shell composition;
feature controllers send user intents but do not derive or override
Server-owned state machines independently.

Simplified Chinese is the default presentation language. English remains
available through an in-product switch, and the selected locale is persisted
only in browser-local preferences. Protocol identifiers, commands, user data,
and server-owned payloads are never translated.

Dark is the default presentation theme. Users can switch to a light theme from
desktop or narrow-screen navigation, and the choice is persisted locally
without changing server-owned state.

## Product Entry and Recovery

ADR-0032 adds an installation-Owner-only recovery-key button in Account and
security, independent of Team selection. It generates a random key locally,
supports private clipboard copying, and requires saved-key confirmation before
replacement. The dialog
explains old-key invalidation and other-browser logout. It retains the exact
candidate/revision for explicit retry after an uncertain response, clears on
success or close, and never writes the key to URLs or browser storage. Server
authorization remains authoritative; ordinary Team Owners see no control.

[ADR-0027](../adr/0027-close-product-entry-and-recovery-flows.md) defines
Central/local/demo setup choices, current-Room readiness and a first-reply
destination. Hosted setup validates during creation, explains safe failures and
Room access, and keeps credentials transient. Member access recovery is an
explicit Owner-issued short-lived code, not a new invitation or password store.

Work creation may add canonical acceptance criteria through simple templates.
Run ambiguity is read from the exact Run record; acknowledgement and retry stay
separate authorized actions. Evidence review reuses the verified Artifact preview.
Workbench filters/cursors and backward Room history remain Server-authorized;
history loading neither advances live sync nor replaces a newer navigation.
Loaded Room pages remain available until leaving that Room; refreshing Work
preserves the loaded page window and waits for an in-flight load-more request.
Protected response generation checks reject stale successes as well as 401s,
so switching identities cannot restore an old Team or credential output.
Derived Run recovery refreshes also require the originating session and detail
to remain current. A protected 401 during initial activation returns directly
to the correct trusted/local entry gate, even before React effects reattach.
Reconciliation after a failed initial Room read restores backward pagination;
normal live refresh does not reset an already loaded history window.
Uncertain Run recovery commands keep exact identity-bound receipts in this
tab's session storage across detail navigation/reload. Storage failure blocks
new submission; receipts never replace server authorization or revision checks.
Attempt changes synchronously hide old evidence and disable recovery until the
selected attempt's evidence loads. Task creation supports optional criteria,
bounded dialog scrolling, contained Tab navigation and Escape/focus restoration.

## Primary Surfaces

[ADR-0034](../adr/0034-separate-collaboration-and-management.md) separates
Collaboration (default Workbench, Task detail and Room conversation) from
Management (Agents, Devices, Team and members, Account and security). Inventory
pages show status and explicit actions; creation, pairing and configuration are
mounted only when requested. Account settings remain available without a Team.
The same-session, same-Team Collaboration destination is remembered in memory
across management visits, including Task/tab/filter context; existing scoped
draft and Room controllers remain the only owners. Team/identity changes clear
transient forms and cannot restore another context. Device registration and
Agent availability are presented separately. Existing view links remain valid,
and Device/security links extend the same access-checked URL mechanism.

Acceptance includes isolated production-browser desktop/720/390 layouts,
keyboard focus, Chinese/English and light/dark presentation, plus actual App
navigation/draft/permission regressions. This does not change installation,
backend authority, HTTP-only Hosted scope or local client configuration.

[ADR-0028](../adr/0028-preserve-continuous-web-work.md) adds Work creation and
navigation-only next-action shortcuts, allowlisted authorized URL restoration,
bounded Server Task search and identity/context-scoped tab-local draft/outbox
recovery. Session invalidation clears saved unsent work; storage failure is
visible and never causes automatic replay. Shared session and Room controllers
own lifecycle fences and synchronization, not Server domain decisions.

Work creates a Task through the existing selected-Room API and opens its detail.
Next-action shortcuts only select Room input, Results or the exact Run evidence;
they never submit, approve, acknowledge or retry on behalf of the user.
Search applies to the authorized Server projection, including unloaded pages,
with trimmed case-insensitive literal title matching and exact numeric/`TASK-n`
display-number matching. Search is bounded to 100 Unicode code points and resets
the page window; changed filters invalidate old cursors and late responses.

Navigation URLs allow only Team, Room, one current Task, view, detail tab/Run,
Work scope/status/owner and search. External links and browser history resolve
current Team/Room/Task access before selection; invalid or inaccessible targets
fall back to Work with visible feedback. Linked Runs must belong to the loaded
Task before evidence requests. Unknown fields, duplicate keys, malformed IDs,
ambiguous Task combinations and queries over 2048 characters are rejected or
discarded; copied links never contain credentials, drafts or recovery receipts.

- Authenticated Team and Room shell.
- Default Team Workbench with Mine/Team scope, authorized Task grouping, every
  attention reason, criteria coverage, budget/telemetry, latest Run/Result, and
  exact next-action projection.
- Trusted-team Owner setup/recovery, member invitation claim, session restore,
  logout, and Owner invitation controls without exposing session credentials to
  JavaScript.
- Ordered message timeline and thread view.
- Safe Markdown/GFM narrative rendering for durable and provisional messages,
  including headings, lists, tables, task lists, links, images, and code blocks.
- Unified Room composer for messages, single-Agent Runs, and adaptive
  multi-Agent Discussions.
- Current-Task selector and Task creation flow; routed Messages and Discussions
  always submit the selected Task and terminal Tasks disable new work.
- Task clarification card with bounded choices or a free-form authorized Room
  answer, explicitly distinguished from local Runtime permission approval.
- Selected-Task Artifact snapshot cards and an on-demand pure-text preview for
  verified Patch, Markdown, and JSON bytes, explicitly labeled as semantically
  untrusted evidence.
- Inline `@` suggestions that resolve typed display names to stable Agent IDs.
- Agent roster with presence and capability summaries.
- Agent cards show the authenticated managed Runtime's bounded file-access
  summary as read-only, Workspace write, local policy, or not reported. This
  surface never receives or renders Workspace paths, commands, tools,
  environment variables, Provider details, accounts, or credentials.
- Run cards with live status, replies, cancellation, and failure details.
- Discussion Wave progress, member Run outcomes, goal adjustment,
  finalization, extension, pause, and stop controls without presenting a soft
  budget as a completion target.
- Dedicated Agent management workspace with roster and availability summaries.
- Managed Bridge approval, MCP setup, Device revocation, and local policy guidance.
- Owner-only Device pairing with a browser-local one-time claim proof, locally
  encoded QR, manual short code, exact verification phrase, explicit
  approve/reject/cancel controls, and recoverable terminal-state projection.
- Target pairing trust presentation that omits overrides for public CA and
  carries one closed exact-origin private descriptor in local link/QR fragments
  without implying that Bridge trust changes browser or OS trust.
- Same-owner central Agent creation from an online Bridge template, with a
  transient management-code input and durable pending, rejected, or ready
  status but no local Runtime configuration or saved-code projection.
- Owner-only Central Hosted Agent setup after Server startup: supported
  provider/model selection, write-only API-key input, content-free connection
  test, explicit initial Rooms, create, replace/revoke credential, and
  disable/re-enable controls without deployment configuration.
- Selected Room participant roster projected from Team members and visible Agents.
- Owner-only Room settings for participant access, multi-Agent Discussion,
  `@all`, Agent-to-Agent handoffs, and maximum handoff depth.
- Contextual navigation for Collaboration or Management, with Room participants
  available on demand in conversation rather than beside configuration pages.
- The same area and destination controls at desktop and narrow widths.
- Persistent light and dark presentation themes for desktop and narrow screens.

There is no native desktop GUI in the MVP. Runtime access is provided by the
optional headless Bridge, keeping existing agent clients unchanged.

## Target Work Information Architecture

[ADR-0022](../adr/0022-make-task-run-and-result-the-primary-work-model.md)
changes the default authenticated destination to **Work** while retaining Chat,
Agents, and Devices as first-class destinations. `WEB-046` provides the default
Team Workbench and `WEB-047` provides its Task, Run, Result, Artifact,
Discussion, and bounded Audit detail views. These remain first-class Work
surfaces rather than chat disclosures.

Work consumes a Team-scoped, Room-authorized read model and groups Tasks that
need human action, are executing, await review, are blocked, or recently
completed. It never loops over every Room in the browser, stores independent
dashboard counters, invents a percentage, treats unknown telemetry as zero, or
uses a display number as an API identity. Cursor, filters, all attention reasons,
primary badge, latest Run/Result, criteria coverage, budget usage, and next
action come from the Server projection.

The browser performs one `/api/teams/:teamId/work-items` read for the selected
scope and refreshes it from the authenticated Team change cursor. It never
enumerates Room Task endpoints to assemble Work. Card labels use `TASK-n` only
for presentation; opening a card carries the opaque Task and Room identities.
The Mine scope includes Tasks owned by the Member plus Tasks assigned to an
Agent owned by that Member, still bounded to Rooms the Member can access.

Task detail opens Overview with goal, canonical criteria, human Owner, explicit
Agent assignments, lifecycle/scheduling state, attention, current execution,
latest Result, open questions, budget, and next action. Runs, Results, Artifacts,
Discussion, and Audit are separate views. Result review controls appear only to
the Task Owner or Team Owner and never infer permission from the projected next
action.

The detail controller reads one authorized Task and then its Task-scoped Runs,
Results, Artifacts, and Room Discussion projection. `GET /api/tasks/:taskId/runs`
and `GET /api/runs/:runId` authorize against the Run's current Room before
returning immutable identity and state; existing event and Context Manifest
routes remain the detailed evidence sources. Refresh races are last-request-wins
and a Workbench wakeup refreshes data without resetting the selected tab.

Run detail shows the authoritative state plus optional durable diagnostic phase,
execution identity, trigger, redacted frozen Context Manifest, closed permission
summary, ordered events, provisional output, terminal outcome, and linked Result.
Connection loss remains metadata and `outcome_unknown` remains visible. A retry
creates a new attempt; retry after ambiguity requires a separate explicit human
acknowledgement. Generic Run pause is not shown.

Result detail renders immutable submission version, exact source, definition,
and criteria revisions, criterion claims, existing evidence links, risks,
questions, next actions, and append-only review decision. Correction creates a
new version; accept/reject never edits Agent-authored content. An authorized
Member may turn one keyed next action into an idempotently linked same-Room child
Task without copying evidence or acceptance. Accepted Result and Task
completion may be one revisioned command, and a stale Result or partial Result
with an unresolved required criterion cannot masquerade as completion.

`WEB-073` adds an expandable **Review evidence by criterion** panel to each
Result. It lazily reads the Room-authorized acceptance-evidence endpoint and
keeps the original criteria, attributed current/earlier claims, structural
diagnostics and exact Artifact/candidate verification distinct. No claim,
rejected/superseded history, stale revisions and omitted Results/candidates/
receipts remain explicit. Configured required checks passing is not human
acceptance. Candidate details expose checkpoint, Run, plan/node, commit/tree,
input and profile/receipt digests, without private source bytes or commands.
The panel refreshes against Task/Workbench revisions and fences old Result,
member, session and aborted request responses. Both locales support loading,
denied access, identity mismatch and retry; the two-column comparison stacks at
680 px and long source identifiers wrap at 390 px. Existing review controls
and submission authorities are unchanged.

Room Chat remains the ordered discussion surface. New UI requires an explicit
runnable Task or visible quick-work default before sending an Agent Mention.
No-Mention messages remain ordinary conversation. Run and Result lifecycle adds
only bounded linked summaries to the Room rather than copying output streams,
Result bodies, review controls, or evidence.

Result proposal and review append idempotent system summaries containing only
the Team-local Task label, Result version/state, optional completion fact, and
an opaque same-origin Work link. The Room renderer accepts that navigation only
for closed Team, Room, and Task identity shapes. It does not copy Result prose,
review reasons, evidence, local paths, or execution logs into Chat.

Work tabs implement roving focus with Arrow Left/Right, Home, End, Enter, and
Space behavior. Untrusted Task, Run, Result, Artifact, and Discussion text is
rendered as text rather than executable markup. At the narrow breakpoint the
content grids become one column while the tab list owns its bounded horizontal
scroll, preventing page-level overflow.

## Data Flow

HTTP reads establish a snapshot and an authenticated Team change channel wakes
reconciliation. Every notification has a monotonic cursor; gaps, server restart,
tab visibility changes, and reconnects trigger bounded HTTP reconciliation.
Healthy event delivery replaces broad two-second polling, while a slower
fallback remains available after channel failure. Optimistic messages carry a
client-generated idempotency identity, remain visibly pending until
acknowledged, and expose an explicit retry after failure without duplicating the
server Message or its Runs.

For managed Agents that publish streaming capability, the same Team change
channel wakes cursor-based Run-event reads. The browser keeps at most one
provisional output bubble per active Run, applies ordered additions and reset
boundaries, and reconstructs it from sequence zero after a reload. A final
`run.reply` removes that projection and the normal durable Room Message takes
its place, so partial output is never inserted into message history and cannot
appear twice. Final-only Agents retain the existing Run-card behavior.

Reasoning summaries and tool lifecycle use the same event cursor but render as
one compact disclosure inside the owning Agent flow. Active work opens by
default; completed work can collapse. Reasoning uses the existing untrusted
Markdown renderer, while tool rows show only the server-approved name and
phase. The UI never labels this as hidden chain-of-thought and never receives
structured commands, arguments, tool input/output, or approvals as activity.

Team change notifications carry either a full-Team hint or changed Room IDs.
Run-output/activity hints fetch only the selected Room's current Runs plus
unseen events. Other selected-Room hints add messages and Discussions. Agents,
members, Devices, and Room settings are reloaded only for full, legacy, reset,
or reconnect reconciliation; unrelated Room hints do not trigger selected-Room
reads.

The UI uses schemas and generated types from `packages/contracts/`. Capability
flags control whether start, resume, interrupt, handoff, or managed execution
controls are shown.

The selected Task loads its clarification records independently of message and
Run projections. Each waiting question appears in normal dock layout above the
composer, names the requesting Agent, and explains that the answer becomes a
Room Message and same-Task continuation rather than a local permission grant.
Submitting an answer is single-flight, replaces the waiting record with the
Server result, and reconciles the Room so the new bounded Run and Messages are
visible.
The clarification read reconciles deadline and scope before rendering, so a
canceled or expired record disappears from the answer surface and retains its
durable resolution reason for history.

The selected Task also loads its canonical Artifact page. Only text-bearing
Patch, Markdown and JSON `snapshot_blob` records offer preview. Binary commit
bundles remain visible as size/digest/type metadata, with no preview, execution
or Git-import button; Result evidence uses the same boundary. An on-demand
Member-authorized endpoint
re-resolves the canonical content identity, checks Team scope and the sealed
size/SHA-256, requires valid UTF-8, and returns at most 200,000 characters with
an explicit truncation bit. Its JSON response is `no-store` and `nosniff` and
contains no Workspace path, Blob storage key, or source filename. The browser
renders Patch, Markdown, and JSON bodies inside one escaped `<pre>` boundary;
it never parses HTML or uses the normal Markdown renderer. The visible label
keeps byte integrity distinct from trust in the Agent-authored meaning.

Device pairing is a separate Owner-only presentation controller. It generates
`claimSecret` and create/decision operation identities in the browser, stores
the in-progress proof only in Team-and-Member-scoped `sessionStorage`, and sends the exact
contract body to the Server. A lost create response is retried with the same
`claimSecret` and operation ID, including after a component remount. A lost
decision response is reconciled through the authenticated Owner projection;
the same decision operation ID is retried only while the authoritative state
still permits it. Active sessions poll at a bounded interval and also expose a
manual refresh. Terminal state removes the secret from storage and React
state before offering another pairing.

The pairing link uses the registered `convenewire://pair-device` scheme with
Server origin, session identity and expiry in its query and `claimSecret` in
the URI fragment. QR encoding runs locally in a lazy browser chunk; no link or
proof is sent to a third-party QR service. Once a Device claims the session,
the Web hides the link and renders only the closed safe Device summary,
verification phrase and Owner decisions. It never receives or renders a
Server Token, Device credential, poll secret, Runtime configuration, command,
environment value, tool setting, permission detail or Workspace path. Server
authorization and pairing transitions remain authoritative; hiding the panel
from non-Owners is presentation, not the security boundary.

`WEB-048` implements the ADR-0023 projection. For a public-CA session the Owner
projection and generated link omit all trust override fields. For an explicitly
private-scoped installation, the authenticated projection supplies one closed
public descriptor containing the exact origin, stable installation ID,
monotonic trust epoch and canonical CA DER digest. Web validates and copies that
exact object into the locally generated link/QR fragment beside the claim
secret; status refresh must preserve the same descriptor and a claimed private
Bridge must report the scoped-trust capability. Web never fetches a CA private
key, chooses a digest, or infers trust from browser state. Server owns inclusion
of that immutable session descriptor in the verification-phrase transcript.

Private-scoped first pairing does not render the short code because a short code
is not a Server identity proof. Terminal clearing removes both claim proof and
trust descriptor from React, the DOM and `sessionStorage`. Copy states explicitly
that scoped trust applies only to Bridge, requires no Windows or macOS CA
installation, and cannot make another browser trust a private certificate; the
UI never asks a user to click through a certificate warning or install a root as
the normal path.

The configured local Bridge/Desktop Console may separately offer the BRG-072
private-browser trust assistant. It is not part of pairing and never appears in
the Central Web UI. It requires a deliberate local click, displays the complete
CA fingerprint and warns that installing a root is persistent current-user
trust. Copying its self-contained Windows command performs no network request,
does not issue or include a client-entry ticket and does not mutate trust by
itself. A paired-Central or trust change closes the assistant and clears the
stale command. Public CA remains the normal browser path; neither surface asks
the user to bypass a certificate warning.

BRG-073 renames that local action to describe another computer rather than one
operating system. The dialog offers separate Windows and macOS current-user
commands derived from the same validated CA and explicitly states that Linux
trust setup depends on its distribution/browser. Platform selection and copy
remain browser-local, issue no entry ticket and never imply that ConveneWire or
private-CA browser access is Windows-only.

Discussion views render the central ProgressSnapshot, Wave, member Turns, and
OrchestrationDecision; they do not derive completion from Agent prose. The
timeline shows one logical round without a hard-limit denominator. While its
all-settled barrier is open, the status shows progress such as `1/2 已结束`
and one state chip per Agent Run. Replies appear as they arrive, but the UI does
not imply that policy advanced before the barrier closed. The Room timeline
retains durable arrival order. Participant-order normalization belongs to the
server's progress aggregate and next-Wave bounded instruction; the Web client
does not reorder or duplicate Agent Messages.

Member jobs in one Wave are never presented as separate rounds. A `partial`
Wave keeps successful replies visible and identifies failed members; an
all-failed Wave explains why human action is required. The single-Agent
finalization Wave has an explicit conclusion-generating state. When a
Discussion is waiting, paused, or terminal, its status keeps the current or most
recent closed Wave available, including each member's terminal reason. The
docked surface defaults to a single compact summary row containing authoritative
Discussion state, truncated goal, and member progress. Expanding that row reveals
Wave details and controls; a transition to a terminal state collapses it again so
completed work does not permanently consume conversation space. At a soft
boundary the expanded UI offers continue solving, adjust goal, or finish with a
conclusion rather than exposing internal Wave allocation.

The Room composer classifies one submission by its distinct structured Agent
identities and the current Server-owned Room policy. No Mention stores a Room
message and one Mention creates a normal Run. Two to five Mentions create an
adaptive Discussion whose goal is the message body when Discussions are
enabled; when they are disabled, the same submission creates one Message and
parallel one-shot Runs so each selected Agent replies once. The Web resolves a
complete `@Agent name` only when it exactly matches one current-Room identity;
the reserved exact command `@all` expands to the full current-Room Agent roster
only when allowed. Prefix, substring, and role matches never route, and
same-name commands remain ambiguous until the user selects a specific identity.
Selecting and removing chips keeps the visible tokens and stable IDs
synchronized; the Server revalidates Room membership, Agent availability,
Discussion participant policy, and the single-open-Discussion Room invariant.
The composer previews exact matches before submission. Browser acceptance types
an exact full name, a non-matching prefix, and `@all` without sending a Message;
component coverage verifies the resulting single-Run and Discussion payloads.

The composer offers a default-off **Keep last @ mentions** switch. Its boolean
preference is persisted in browser-local storage. Draft text and its resolved
targets instead use the separate bounded tab-local storage described below.
When enabled, an ordinary submission pre-fills the next
draft with the resolved Agent names and stable-ID chips. Successful Discussion
creation does the same, but a late response cannot overwrite a newer draft or
another Room/Task. The retained tokens remain visible, editable, and removable;
turning the switch off removes automatically retained tokens without deleting
the user's new message text. A draft containing only retained tokens cannot
accidentally submit another Run. An exact `@all` retains its concrete recipients,
not a dynamic expansion to future roster members. Existing multi-Agent policy,
five-Agent limits, and active-Discussion guards still apply.

Changing Room or Task saves and restores independent User/Team/Room/Task drafts;
signed-out or expired identities clear their saved drafts and failed messages.
The versioned `sessionStorage` envelope allows 20 contexts per User, 10 pending
ordinary messages per context, 20,000 characters per message and 500,000 total
serialized characters. Entries expire 24 hours after modification; storage
failure or limits show a not-saved warning without blocking editing or sending.
The composer has no Clear Draft button. Its saved/not-saved status follows the
browser-local Mention preference hint inline and wraps on narrow screens.
Enter sends through the same enabled submit button as a click; Shift+Enter
inserts a newline. IME confirmation never submits, and an open Mention menu
consumes Enter to choose its current candidate before any send (`WEB-075`).
Closing a tab or switching devices is not a durability guarantee. Malformed
stored data is discarded; secrets and Discussion commands are never stored.
Recovered pending messages become failed/uncertain and never auto-send.
Explicit retry revalidates current Room recipients before using the original
payload and client Message ID. Removed, disabled, or renamed retained Agents lose their old tokens
rather than resolving them to a different identity. Presence alone does not
clear a target: offline delivery keeps the existing queue semantics. Failed
ordinary messages retain the original outbox payload and client Message ID;
retry never reads or overwrites the current draft's recipients. These are Web
presentation preferences only, not a Server routing fallback or session policy.

Timeline messages resolve their visible author from the stable `senderId` and
the current Team roster. Registered Agent and member names are shown directly;
the generic localized Agent label is reserved for missing historical identities.
Durable and provisional content use the same React-native Markdown renderer.
Raw HTML is ignored, protocol URLs retain the renderer's safe URL transform,
cross-origin HTTP(S) links open with `noopener noreferrer`, and cross-origin
images render as an explicit external link instead of issuing an implicit
request. Same-origin and relative images may load lazily without a referrer.
Central's Content Security Policy independently restricts image requests to
same-origin and `data:` resources. The Web does not import Agentdown directly:
Agentdown is currently a Vue 3 Runtime, while this application is React 19;
shipping both UI runtimes would duplicate message and Run ownership. The Web
instead follows the same block-safety principles at its existing projection
boundary.

The current MVP separates Team conversation from the Agent control plane. The
Room view owns messages, mentions, and Runs. The Agents view owns runtime
roster, status, managed enrollment approval, MCP credentials, demo runtimes,
Central Hosted profiles, and trusted Devices. Fake Agents are explicitly
labeled as simulations and are not presented as production connections.
Secrets are shown only in the immediate setup result and are never returned by
list APIs.

ADR-0026 makes Hosted setup optional. An unconfigured installation shows one
non-blocking Owner action and otherwise preserves the existing Agent, Room, and
readiness experience. The form explains that Hosted Agents send authorized
Room context to the selected external provider and have no computer, shell,
filesystem, Workspace, or Bridge capability. Initial Room selection is
explicit and never defaults to every Room.

The API-key control is write-only and cleared after every settled create,
replace, revoke, or failed transport attempt. A configured card receives only
provider/model labels, profile revision, configured/revoked state, safe latest
test observation, derived Presence, and active-work fence. It never receives
plaintext, ciphertext, nonce/tag, Authorization headers, provider response
bodies, account/quota detail, or a reversible mask. A Hosted badge is distinct
from managed, manual, and Fake and does not claim local Runtime availability.

The setup state machine renders `unconfigured`, `testing`, `ready`, `degraded`,
`revoked`, and `disabled` without converting provider reachability into Central
health. Configuration and credential mutations remain revision-fenced and
surface stale-state recovery. The explicit Server `configurationLocked` and
`hasActiveWork` projection includes queued as well as executing work; Web does
not infer this fence from Presence. Agent snapshot changes refresh the lock
without discarding an unsaved model draft.
Hosted Runs reuse normal Run cards, streaming output, terminal replies,
handoffs, and Discussion progress. The first version renders no Hosted Result
proposal, review, Task-completion, or ambiguity-acknowledgement control.

Each Agent card presents the Server-owned `runtimePolicy.filesystemAccess`
projection without interpreting missing data. `read-only` means the managed
Runtime cannot write to its Workspace; `workspace-write` means it can write
within local Workspace limits; `local-policy` means the concrete rule remains
on the Device. A missing projection is labeled **not reported**, rather than
being guessed from presence, role, Runtime name, or integration mode. The badge
title explains these semantics in the selected locale while keeping local
configuration out of the browser payload and DOM.

The Room timeline is the only vertically scrolling conversation surface. Its
Discussion status and composer are docked after the timeline in normal layout
flow, so their dynamic height never covers Message content. Discussion status
uses a compact, keyboard-accessible disclosure row by default; its detailed
Wave surface may scroll within a bounded height while the composer remains
visible. Mention suggestions may overlay the dock but never the persisted
timeline. Request errors participate in workspace layout above the timeline
and clear when the user edits the draft, so an error cannot cover the Send
action or stale-block a corrected command.

The desktop context sidebar contains only the Team identity and selected Room
participants. The participant roster fills the column below the Team identity,
uses the sidebar itself as its surface, and scrolls only when the member list
exceeds the available height. Room switching, Room creation, locale selection,
and return to Chat are compact workspace-header actions. Agent management
remains a separate global rail destination, so configuration is not stacked
below Room members.

The roster and Mention suggestions are scoped to the selected Room rather than
the whole Team. A Team Owner can open Room settings beside the roster count or
from the compact composer policy summary. The same accessible modal
independently includes or excludes Team Members and enabled Agents and configures
Discussion, `@all`, Agent handoff, and depth policy. Every Team Owner remains
selected and cannot be removed; non-Owners never receive the control. The
composer summary exposes the effective mode without turning Discussion into a
separate Send action.

Room settings shows each Member's identity, current-user marker and owned-Agent
count, and each Agent's role, owner, integration mode and reported availability.
Duplicate names include a distinguishing stable-ID suffix; complete names wrap
and remain available in titles. Search matches names, roles, owners and IDs.
The joined-only filter reflects the saved roster, while selected counts reflect
the pending edit. Selecting an Agent immediately explains any automatically
selected owner, who can be independently deselected unless they are a Team
Owner. Offline Agents remain selectable; disabled Agents explain why they cannot
be added and can still be removed if already selected. These are Web presentation
changes over the existing Room settings API (`WEB-074`).

`WEB-076` adds configured-model labels to Room settings, the Room roster, Agent
inventory/details and Mention choices, with model-name search. Missing values
read "Model: not reported"; offline managed values read "Last reported model"
and expose the independent observation timestamp. Explicit configuration and
per-Run actual model evidence are distinct; changing configuration does not
rewrite historical Runs. See [ADR-0059](../adr/0059-show-agent-configured-models.md).

An empty installation presents a three-step Team, Room, and Agent onboarding
flow in the main workspace. Required fields use native browser validation;
actions remain visibly available unless a request is already in progress.
After onboarding, an always-visible action in the desktop Team rail and mobile
navigation opens the same accessible Team creation dialog. Successful creation
selects the new Team immediately; creating a second Team never requires leaving
or deleting the current Team.

Team Owners have a persistent resource-lifecycle control in the desktop rail.
Its accessible modal lists active and archived Teams and Rooms, supports inline
rename plus archive/restore, explains history retention, and keeps recovery
available after ordinary navigation hides an archived resource. Agent cards
independently expose disable/enable actions and visibly distinguish disabled
Agents. The current Room heading also exposes an Owner-only action menu with a
recoverable archive shortcut and an explicit confirmation dialog. The shortcut
disappears with the archived Room, while restoration remains centralized in the
resource-lifecycle surface. Active Runs or Discussions disable the menu action
with a visible reason; Server fences remain authoritative if state changes
during confirmation.

In trusted-team mode, an unauthenticated browser never calls the local
bootstrap route. It renders setup only when the Server reports an empty
installation, accepts an Owner recovery secret only in component memory, and
clears it immediately after the request. Member invitation tokens are read
from the URL fragment, removed before network activity, and exchanged for an
HttpOnly session Cookie. The UI never reads or stores the Cookie value.

ADR-0040 permits the same trusted-team surface on one explicitly configured
same-host LAN HTTP browser origin while Bridge traffic remains private-CA
HTTPS. The Server, not browser JavaScript, selects the Cookie name and transport
attributes and enforces the exact browser Origin. Product copy identifies this
as convenient but unencrypted, does not suggest disabling certificate
revocation, and keeps private-browser CA installation only on the advanced
private-HTTPS path.

## Interaction and Security Rules

- Exact Mention commands resolve only against registered current-Room Agent
  names; `@all` is the only reserved expansion command.
- Typing `@` opens the visible Agent suggestion list; selecting a result inserts
  its display name while retaining its stable identity for submission.
- Mention identities are ordered and unique. Removing a selected token removes
  its stable identity; complete-token matching prevents one Agent name from
  matching another name's prefix. Same-name chips retain their role labels for
  disambiguation. Five participants is the Web submission maximum.
- The composer has one Send action and no separate Discussion tab. Existing
  Discussion goal adjustment reuses its status panel without changing a Room
  message draft.
- The docked Discussion summary remains one row until explicitly expanded;
  terminal transitions restore the compact state while preserving on-demand
  access to final Wave details and failure reasons.
- Cancellation actions show their current authoritative outcome.
- **Finish and generate conclusion** is the primary Discussion stop action;
  stop-after-round, pause, and resume are applied at the Wave boundary, while
  immediate cancellation explicitly targets every active member Run.
- Bodyless HTTP requests do not declare a JSON content type.
- Render messages, Runtime output, and failure details as untrusted content.
- Render Artifact snapshot previews only as escaped plain text; a verified
  digest does not make the content trusted or executable.
- Never expose device secrets or raw Runtime environment values.
- Agent provisioning selectors show only active Devices whose current Bridge
  connection advertises provisioning support and online managed templates owned
  by the current Member. This is presentation filtering, not authority: the
  Server and Bridge independently revalidate every identity and capability.
- Keep a management code only in the controlled input until one submission
  settles. Clear it after success, rejection, or transport failure; never put
  it in request history, browser storage, URLs, logs, or status projection.
- Keep a Hosted provider key only in its controlled write-only input until one
  submission settles. Clear it on every outcome; never copy it into query
  state, local/session storage, URLs, errors, analytics, DOM status text, or a
  retry object.
- Show Hosted setup/mutation actions only to Team Owners and exact configured
  profile state only inside its Team. Browser filtering never replaces Server
  authorization, fixed provider-origin validation, or Room scope checks.
- Meet keyboard navigation and visible focus requirements for core workflows.

## Verification and Tasks

Component tests cover onboarding state transitions, Chinese-default locale,
Agent management, enrollment approval, the unified no-Mention, one-Mention,
and multi-Mention paths, Room-scoped participant editing and Mention filtering,
resource rename/archive/restore, Agent disable/enable, participant identity,
Wave barrier progress, member failure, finalization, and finish controls. They
also assert that no separate
Discussion entry remains and no duplicate Agent reply is rendered. Existing
browser acceptance covers message, Mention, reconnect, Run progress, reply, and
cancellation. A public end-to-end two-Agent parallel Discussion persists its
conclusion in `QA-010`. Existing UI work is tracked through `WEB-019`; Wave
presentation and acceptance are completed by `WEB-020` and `QA-010`.
Composer and Discussion controller extraction is tracked by `WEB-038`.

`WEB-041` adds the browser-local Mention retention preference. Focused hook
regressions and the full-App integration cover continuation, stable identity,
scope/roster changes, outbox retry, and stale completions; isolated production
browser screenshots and limits are recorded in
[the local acceptance](../acceptance/web-041-mention-retention.md).

`WEB-044` adds same-owner creation from an online managed Agent template. The
form sends only request, Device, template, new-Agent name/role, and transient
management-code fields. Pending, ambiguously delivered, and
`configuration_failed` requests are reselected with the same request ID after a
new code is entered; other rejected requests receive a new identity. Focused component
coverage exercises both 6- and 8-digit inputs, ownership filtering, all request
states, every closed rejection reason, retry identity, and code clearing. The
full-App browser-DOM flow proves the same behavior through the production page
coordinator. Exact evidence and the live-browser limitation are recorded in
[the local acceptance](../acceptance/web-044-agent-provisioning.md).

`WEB-050` adds the ADR-0026 Hosted setup and lifecycle surface. Focused
component tests cover Owner/non-Owner visibility, unconfigured startup,
provider/model validation, fixed connection-test projection, explicit Room
selection, create, stale revision, key clearing, replacement, revocation,
disable/re-enable, active-work fences, ready/busy/degraded rendering, and the
absence of local-computer and formal-Result controls. Production browser
acceptance covers Chinese/English, light/dark, keyboard operation, zero console
secret/error leakage, and zero horizontal overflow at desktop, 720 px, and
390 px widths.

`WEB-045` adds the Owner-guided Device pairing panel. Focused component
coverage proves locally encoded QR/link and manual short-code presentation,
closed safe Device projection, explicit phrase confirmation, every Owner
decision, same-proof create recovery across remount, same-operation decision
recovery, terminal proof clearing, and non-Owner absence. Exact evidence and
the boundary to installer and physical-host acceptance are recorded in
[the local acceptance](../acceptance/web-045-device-pairing.md).

`WEB-048` closes the public-versus-private-scoped projection described above.
Focused component coverage proves public omission, exact descriptor
preservation, fragment-only placement, terminal clearing, scoped-capability and
private-short-code fencing, non-Owner absence, local QR generation, and bounded
copy without credentials, private keys, local paths or browser-verification
bypass instructions. Server regressions separately prove phrase binding and
legacy-client rejection.

`WEB-021` replaces first-page polling with a newest-100 snapshot, resumable
cursor deltas, duplicate suppression, and a 500-message browser history bound.
Refresh is single-flight and only merges messages, so a slow response cannot
overwrite a newer Room projection. `WEB-022` reads the existing authorized
Run-event API once for each terminal failure and renders only the error code,
retryable flag, allowlisted category, exit code, and localized recovery
guidance. `WEB-042` adds code-owned guidance for `CODEX_SESSION_IN_USE` and
`CODEX_SESSION_RESUME_FAILED`: it tells the owner to release other local Codex
clients and retry while confirming that the original binding was preserved and
no replacement Thread was created. Raw Runtime stderr, paths, messages, and
unknown detail keys never enter the view model.

`WEB-027` clears an ordinary zero/one-Mention draft into a visible optimistic
row with one client Message ID. A failed row remains in the Room with an
explicit retry action that reuses the same identity; a successful response
merges immediately and then reconciles authoritative history. Composer, Team,
participant, and lifecycle mutations use independent pending state, so an
unrelated control no longer freezes message entry or recovery.

`WEB-029` projects authenticated `run.output_delta` events into an untrusted,
plain-text generating bubble. It preserves one cursor per Run, ignores stale
duplicates, clears on reset or final reply, and discards previews for Runs that
become terminal without a reply. Reload and Team-change reconciliation use the
same reducer, so the live and recovery paths cannot diverge.

`WEB-030` keeps the timeline as the only scrolling conversation surface while
giving it a bounded reading measure, distinct Member and Agent message shells,
larger narrative typography, responsive code/table overflow, and a visually
anchored dock. Streaming and final replies share Markdown rendering so the
authoritative replacement changes state rather than presentation semantics.
Isolated real-browser acceptance covers desktop light/dark themes plus 720 px
and 390 px widths; both narrow layouts retain zero horizontal page overflow and
place the dock immediately after the timeline rather than over its content.

`WEB-031` removes duplicated routing metadata once authoritative Runs exist.
Agent replies use an open narrative row, Member prompts use one restrained
right-aligned bubble, and each triggered Run becomes one compact status panel.
Failure guidance stays attached to its owning Run without stretching sibling
targets or turning Mention labels into empty oversized pills. A component
regression covers the Mention-to-Run replacement, and light/dark real-browser
acceptance confirms the production shell has no horizontal overflow.

`ROOM-007` adds the Owner-only Room collaboration settings surface and compact
composer summary. Component coverage proves atomic policy/participant writes,
disabled `@all`, one-shot multi-Agent submission, and retained multi-target
outbox retries. Settings open and Team-change reconciliation load the combined
Room settings resource, while revision-fenced writes reload newer state instead
of overwriting another client. Direct Mention parsing uses the longest known
exact Agent name before current-Room eligibility. Isolated real-browser
acceptance proves two fake Agents each reply once without creating a Discussion,
while light theme and 760 px and 390 px settings layouts retain zero horizontal
overflow.

`WEB-035` adds the inline activity disclosure and `WEB-036` scopes healthy
live reconciliation to the changed Room. Reducer tests cover ordered reasoning
and tool lifecycle, while Team-change tests cover aggregated Room hints and the
full-refresh compatibility fallback.

Accepted `WEB-066` owns the presentation-only Graphite Control Plane redesign. A shared
dark/light token system makes canvas and structural surfaces neutral, assigns
brand/selection/primary interaction to indigo, and reserves green for healthy
or successful state. Shell, navigation, forms, cards, overlays, Room, Work,
Plan, Evidence and management surfaces must share legible typography and one
focus/semantic-state hierarchy without changing component ownership, commands,
authorization, navigation or authoritative fact order. Its frozen acceptance
record is `docs/acceptance/web-066-central-visual-system-goal.md`.

## Everyday work efficiency

WEB-067 through WEB-071 implement the Owner-authorized
[everyday work goal](../acceptance/qa-064-everyday-work-efficiency.md).
The Web passes attention, Room, Agent and priority filters to the existing
authorized Workbench API and retains them in validated navigation intent.
Search waits for a short idle interval and completed IME composition; scope
changes cancel old requests immediately. Pagination remains Server-owned.

Result summaries reuse safe Markdown rendering. Explicit copy/download produces
a bounded Markdown report from the selected authorized Result, including its
version, review state, criterion claims, risks and evidence links. A report never
upgrades a claim to a verification/integration fact or includes raw credentials,
client paths or unrequested Artifact bytes.

A bounded, filter-independent Workbench attention query powers a sidebar
indicator across pages. It represents available actionable work, not an exact
Team-wide count, and clears on logout, Team changes or failed authorization.
The first version needs no browser notification permission or external channel.

Copying a Task explicitly pre-fills a new editable draft with its title, goal
and criteria, preserving its completion policy. It uses the existing create API and copies no assignments, Runs,
Results, Plan, review, budget usage, parent linkage or local grants. Execution
Agent selection happens separately through existing Task/Room controls.

The common plan editor changes only explicitly presented fields in a full
cloned definition. Unexposed graph, source, repository and gate fields survive
unchanged. Saving retains a new revision through the existing API; approval
continues to require separate human review of the exact revision and digest.
Advanced JSON editing remains available for the full definition.
The form exposes plan/node titles, new-node goals, exact Agent selections,
concurrency and plan/node budgets; linked Task definitions remain pinned.
Editor-open revision pins survive refresh, and an ambiguous revision response
locks editing while an exact retained command is retried. The disposable
product preview includes both an editable draft and the approved replanning
fixture for separate acceptance.

## Dependencies

Team/Room, Task Collaboration, Registry, Run Orchestration, Runtime Adapters,
Bridge pairing APIs, and Security.

## Client owner collaboration entry

ADR-0035 adds explicit self/existing/new-member Device pairing with initial Room selection, owner-default human selection when adding an Agent to a Room, and an identity-confirmed client entry screen. The screen clears fragment proofs immediately and never silently replaces browser identity. Client sessions expose only their authorized Team and ordinary-member authority; navigation still resolves current Room access.

## Discussion explanations and observed usage

[ADR-0042](../adr/0042-explain-and-measure-discussion-selection.md) keeps the
existing authenticated Discussion APIs and controls. WEB-072 renders frozen
member reasons, actual Run lifecycle counts and elapsed wall time separately
from budget slots; unknown token and currency telemetry is labeled unavailable.
Version 1 snapshots and older Server responses remain readable without
reconstructed reasons or fabricated zero spending. QA-066 owns acceptance.

## Preauthorized Room development

[ADR-0061](../adr/0061-continue-development-from-conversation.md) makes the normal
Room composer the primary entry. The Agent derives development intent and
acceptance criteria from conversation; humans do not repeat their request in a
separate form. Blockers and delivery return to the source conversation.
Reading and discussion do not create development plans. Current offers supply path-free
readiness and exact source/profile limits. A closed initiation command creates
the existing root Task, approved single-node plan and governed child Task through
Central authority. A model proposal cannot expand the standing owner policy.

Unconfirmed initiation intent, including its title, goal and criteria, is kept
in member/Room-scoped session storage with the operation ID for exact replay;
credentials and repository bytes are not stored there. Corrupt pending data
blocks fresh submission. The history opens the root Task's canonical evidence
surface. Candidate receipts, verification, bounded PNG reports, visual review,
Result adoption and integration remain distinct. See the real connected
[QA-089 acceptance](../acceptance/qa-089-standing-work-product-loop.md) records
the earlier explicit-form flow; conversational acceptance belongs to RUN-019
and WEB-078 in the task register.
