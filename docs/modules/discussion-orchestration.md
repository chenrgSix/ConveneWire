# Discussion Orchestration Module

## Evidence access/use experiment boundary

[ADR-0047](../adr/0047-screen-evidence-access-and-use.md) permits only an isolated
QA-072 historical replay: frozen original contributions, current Finalizer
instruction rendering, a fixed-source read grant and returned-byte receipts.
The ordinary Result/criterion evidence model remains authoritative; historical
plain replies are not synthesized into structured Result claims. The reader
is experiment tooling, with no new production endpoint, persisted contribution
type, scheduler, selection, completion or acceptance policy. Execution and
interpretation must follow [QA-072](../acceptance/qa-072-evidence-access-use.md).

[QA-073](../acceptance/qa-073-evidence-reader-repair.md) repairs only experiment
tool visibility and diagnostics using an auth-free loopback provider. It must
retain the consumed QA-072 plan, original inputs/results and historical code
identity. No new external-model invocation or production capability is granted.

[ADR-0048](../adr/0048-repeat-evidence-screening-with-manipulation-checks.md)
separately authorizes QA-074's fresh nine-session screening using the repaired
tooling. Manipulation checks govern experiment interpretation only; they add
no production completion or acceptance gate. QA-072 remains consumed.

[ADR-0036](../adr/0036-add-governed-software-team-execution.md) adds structured
decision/plan proposals without execution or Result acceptance authority.
Code review/test pipelines belong to Execution, not Wave semantics. Focused
selection uses frozen policy and immutable per-Wave snapshots. Opt-in read-only
quorum mode now retains an immutable accepted projection and a separate append-
only late-evidence record. Existing terminal Run events remain immutable and
all-settled remains the default. The implementation and physical acceptance
record are retained in
[`DISC-012`](../acceptance/disc-012-read-only-quorum-goal.md).

## Scope

- Prefix: `DISC`
- Implementation: `apps/server/src/discussion/`
- Owns: bounded multi-Agent Discussions, durable Waves, progress projection,
  budget leases, orchestration decisions, and finalization

## Maintenance boundary

[ADR-0045](../adr/0045-freeze-discussion-v1-and-replay-workspace-evidence.md#post-comparison-adoption)
freezes v1 feature expansion. Maintain correctness, security, recovery,
final-answer evidence, explicit controls and actual Run lifecycle. Recommend
Single Agent first for everyday tasks with explicit acceptance criteria;
collaboration is an explicit choice for independent evidence or responsibilities.
This does not change routing, UI defaults or authorization.

The [usage guide](../discussion-usage-guide.md) owns practical task selection
and acceptance. [QA-069](../acceptance/qa-069-workspace-evidence-replay.md) and
[QA-070](../acceptance/qa-070-complex-discussion-results.md) retain comparisons,
raw evidence and limitations. They do not establish general quality gains;
source retrieval, transcript delivery and correct finalization are distinct.
Finalizers may use accepted contributions without rereading every source.

New expansion or value experiments need independent task evidence and a bounded
plan. Consumed experiments stay closed. Existing collaboration workflows and
data remain; retirement is a separate product decision. ADR-0043 continues to
exclude token and monetary accounting. TASKS.md alone tracks delivery.

## Purpose

Discussion Orchestration makes Agent-to-Agent conversation visible in a Room
without allowing Agents or Bridges to route directly to one another. An
ordinary logical round is a durable bulk-synchronous **Wave**: the first Wave,
compatibility mode and unmatched focus use all eligible participants; a later
focused Wave gives each deterministically selected eligible participant one
member Turn and one normal managed or manual Run from the same frozen input
anchor. Replies remain normal Agent-authored Room Messages. The central server
is the only authority for selecting participants and opening or closing Waves.

A Discussion is not a Handoff. Handoff is a bounded delegation lineage that
rejects revisiting an Agent. Discussion may use the same participants again in
later Waves. A Reviewer contributes independently in the same ordinary Wave as
the other participants and cannot inspect peer replies that did not exist when
the Wave started. Its explicit current-Wave approval or rejection replaces the
prior approval evidence. A Wave without an explicit Reviewer opinion preserves
the prior value only when its review-relevant progress projection is unchanged;
otherwise the prior approval is stale and becomes false. Approval is evidence
for a policy that requires review, and the role is preferred when selecting the
separate finalization member; it does not create a serial review Wave.

## Criterion evidence finalization

[ADR-0046](../adr/0046-connect-criteria-contributions-and-verification.md)
authorizes one acceptance-evidence increment within the v1 maintenance freeze.
Members use canonical criterion keys to distinguish facts, references,
inferences, assumptions, verification and gaps. Existing Result proposals may
retain these contributions structurally. A bounded index joins only Results
attributable to accepted prior member Runs and explicitly cited by Result ID in
those accepted turns' `newEvidenceRefs`, using the shared Task criterion evidence
projection. Uncited or later Results do not silently enter the index. Plain
replies remain valid and explicitly unstructured;
the Server never fabricates criterion claims from their prose.

The index is retained in the existing immutable Run instruction. Acceptance
requires same-Wave, quorum-excluded and supplemental late Results to stay out;
current criteria and stale claims to remain distinct; reference existence and
independent verification to remain separate; deterministic ordering, explicit
omission counts, intact required instruction sections and restart/retry identity
to hold within the existing 20,000-code-point limit. Finalizers process supplied
requirements and supported omissions without inventing defects or declaring
Task acceptance. No extra Wave, provider call or private-source access is added.

## Authority Boundary

The control chain is:

```text
Agent Run Reports (untrusted evidence)
  -> durable all-settled Wave barrier
  -> Progress Evaluator (one versioned projection per Wave)
  -> Policy Engine (authoritative decision)
  -> Run Orchestration (durable parallel execution)
  -> Room Message (visible transcript)
```

Agents report observations and recommendations. They cannot set Discussion
state, grant budget, select unauthorized participants, or declare authoritative
completion. Users may request finish, pause, resume, or immediate cancellation.

Under
[ADR-0022](../adr/0022-make-task-run-and-result-the-primary-work-model.md), a
terminal Discussion finalization may propose one immutable Task Result using the
Discussion, its member Runs, final Message, and existing Artifacts as exact
sources. The Orchestrator cannot accept the Result or complete the Task. Result
proposal retry uses one stable operation identity and does not replace the
existing final answer, Wave result anchors, evidence service, or Discussion
budget ledger.

The Orchestrator is a deterministic state machine. The current
`SemanticEvaluator` is a standalone interface and output normalizer with
contract tests; it is not injected into Discussion Orchestration and no model is
called. A future integration may add normalized evidence or a recommendation
for novelty, disagreement, or goal coverage. That output remains evidence only:
it cannot select the next action, bypass policy, or mutate state.

The implementation keeps command coordination and aggregate transitions in
`discussion-orchestrator.ts`. Terminal Run projection is isolated in
`wave-settlement-service.ts`; canceled/restarted and deadline recovery is owned
by `discussion-recovery-service.ts`; bounded instructions, deterministic result
anchors, and fallback output are owned by `discussion-evidence-service.ts`.
Pure terminal/barrier transitions live in `discussion-state.ts`, pure focused
participant selection and its digest live in
`discussion-participant-selector.ts`, and Wave/finalizer planning lives in
`discussion-wave-planner.ts`. Progress evaluation, policy, semantic evidence,
and budget arithmetic retain their standalone units. The pure planners receive
frozen aggregate inputs and return values only; they do not read SQLite, create
Runs, append Messages, or dispatch Bridge deliveries.

The deterministic evaluator sorts successful reports by frozen participant
ordinal, normalizes and hashes visible replies, combines valid structured
question and evidence deltas, and treats missing or malformed assessment fields
as reply-only evidence. An explicit current Reviewer opinion replaces the prior
approval value; no explicit successful opinion retains it, and conflicting
current opinions fail conservatively. Callback arrival order cannot change the
projection.

`DISC-011` is governed by the
[frozen focused-selection goal](../acceptance/disc-011-focused-participant-selection-goal.md).
New Discussions freeze an `all_eligible` or `question_focused` selection mode
and a two-to-five member focused limit. The focused mode keeps the first Wave
broad, then may narrow later Waves only from highest-priority retained open
questions, their retained reporters and exact normalized Agent/Task role terms.
It falls back to all eligible participants when there is no deterministic
match. Review mode and reviewer-required policy keep the frozen Reviewer in
every contribution Wave. Selection remains a pure Central projection and does
not call a model or consume Agent recommendations as authority.

Every new Wave carries an immutable selection snapshot in the same transaction
as its member Turns. Recovery verifies and reuses that snapshot rather than
selecting again. Current Room policy, Room roster, Task state/assignment and
Agent enablement are rechecked before a member Run starts, so the snapshot is
an audit and recovery fact, not continuing execution authority. Existing
Discussions migrate to `all_eligible` compatibility behavior.

[ADR-0042](../adr/0042-explain-and-measure-discussion-selection.md) adds version
2 frozen member explanations while retaining version 1 digest/recovery bytes.
New finalization prefers the eligible frozen Reviewer, then eligible Task
primary, then frozen ordinal. Broad contribution fallbacks are unchanged.
The authorized read projection separately reports bound Run lifecycle counts,
unbound slots and wall time; budget slots count committed execution capacity.
[ADR-0043](../adr/0043-remove-discussion-token-cost-accounting.md) removes token
and monetary-cost accounting, read fields and Web placeholders. QA-065 provides a
bounded real-task comparison with a single-Agent baseline, not a quality claim.

[ADR-0044](../adr/0044-review-final-answers-and-test-discussion-value.md) defines
the finalization review checklist: verify supplied facts and requested items,
correct evidenced errors, preserve correct content and keep uncertainty
explicit. Every new finalizer gets that checklist, regardless of participant
role; ordinary parallel contributors retain their current visibility boundary.
QA-067 uses documentation-owned replay/task fixtures and the same checklist in
the single-Agent baseline. Startup guidance is advisory; offline fallback
coverage is not a live answer-quality experiment or a production policy change.
The [usage guide](../discussion-usage-guide.md) connects current behavior to
reviewed results and explicitly identifies unmeasured startup hypotheses.
[QA-068](../acceptance/qa-068-discussion-continuation.md) owns a separately
authorized continuation of the five incomplete balanced pairs. It reuses the
unchanged packet and retains QA-067's failed attempt; completing its comparison
does not introduce a production routing or startup decision. The complete
six-case evidence shows equal 22/24 criterion coverage and six/eighteen Runs
for Single/Discussion, with failed attempts retained separately. Optional
assessment must pass the existing wire schema before the Bridge emits it;
ADP-019's reply-only fallback preserves delivery without manufacturing approval.

`DISC-012` adds no generic soft barrier. Its accepted target is a separate
`read_only_quorum` completion mode available only when every participant is a
current managed, supplemental-capable, enforceably read-only Agent. The soft
deadline, minimum completed count and required roles are frozen in policy. A
seal pins exact completed Turn/Run/reply/Message sequences and closes the Wave,
progress projection and optional successor atomically; omitted Runs keep their
real lifecycle and their Agents cannot be selected again while live.

Late output remains an ordinary canonical Run fact, but a capable Bridge may
reference it only through a separate operation offered in the frozen Delivery.
The append-only supplemental record is audit evidence, not an amendment: later
prompts and progress read only the seal's accepted Turn set. All-settled Waves,
finalization Waves, coding execution and every Task/Result/proof authority stay
outside this quorum mode.

## Domain Model

| Entity | Required State |
| --- | --- |
| Discussion | ID, Room, Task, root Message, goal, participants, policy, execution model, current Wave, state, reason, version |
| DiscussionWave | ID, Discussion, ordinal, phase, frozen input Message, expected members, immutable selection snapshot/digest, deadline, state, version |
| DiscussionTurn | ID, Wave, member ordinal, speaker, input Message, Run, output Message, terminal reason, assessment |
| DiscussionWaveSeal | ID, Wave, policy threshold/deadline, required roles, ordered accepted Turn/Run/reply/Message sequence pins, digest |
| DiscussionSupplementalEvidence | ID, offered operation, seal, original Device/Agent/Run/Turn, canonical late reply/Message sequence pins, digest |
| ProgressSnapshot | version, goal coverage, open questions, claimed and verified evidence, disagreement, plateau count |
| BudgetLedger | limits, lease, logical Wave usage, committed member-slot usage, extensions, finalization reserve |
| OrchestrationDecision | action, reason, next Wave or finalizer, output mode, input projection version |

`DiscussionWave` is unique by `(discussionId, ordinal)`, and only one Wave may
be open for a Discussion. Member Turns are unique by `(waveId, memberOrdinal)`
and `(waveId, speakerAgentId)`. A decision records the exact Discussion and
ProgressSnapshot versions it used. This fences duplicate workers and stale
evaluators from closing a barrier or scheduling the next Wave twice.

Only one nonterminal Discussion may exist per Task. Independent Tasks in the
same Room may have active Discussions concurrently; their root Messages,
member Runs, result anchors, and finalization remain within the owning Task.

Discussion creation coordinates its root Message, initial budget, participants,
first Wave and ordinary Runs in one managed immediate transaction. A rejected
Task/execution admission or a failed initial Wave leaves no orphan root Message,
partial Discussion or consumed budget. Notifications and external delivery occur
only after commit; this boundary does not add execution authority to Discussion.

## Agent Run Report

Runtime output contains a visible reply and optional structured evidence:

```json
{
  "reply": "The delivery path still needs a cancellation fence.",
  "assessment": {
    "goalSatisfied": false,
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "resolvedQuestionIds": ["question_delivery"],
    "openQuestions": [{
      "id": "question_cancel_race",
      "question": "Which cancellation race remains?",
      "importance": "high"
    }],
    "newEvidenceRefs": ["artifact_patch_1"],
    "disagreementRemaining": "low",
    "newInformationAdded": true,
    "reviewerApproved": false,
    "recommendation": "continue"
  }
}
```

Self-reported booleans and confidence are never authoritative. Unknown,
malformed, or unsupported fields degrade to reply-only evidence and are not
interpreted as completion.

## Wave Execution and Progress Evaluation

Opening an ordinary Wave atomically persists the Wave, immutable selection and
one planned member Turn per selected participant. Eligibility requires the
current Room policy and roster, same Team, non-terminal same-Room Task, current
non-default Task assignment and enabled Agent. It does not require a ready
presence, a particular Owner, or remote-wake capability. Selection starts broad
and narrows a later Wave only from retained highest-priority question evidence;
no match stays broad. All selected members share one input Message and deadline,
and their Runs may start concurrently. Replies appear as they arrive, but no
ProgressSnapshot or next action is committed until every member is terminal or
the deadline resolves missing members.

The ordinary Wave deadline is the earlier of the Discussion deadline and
`waveTimeoutSeconds`. A queued member becomes `expired` when it passes; an
accepted or working member becomes `outcome_unknown` because execution may have
started. An `input_required` Run is terminalized as `outcome_unknown` with a
durable `input_required` reason because the Wave cannot resume it in place. The
Discussion remains at the open barrier until all other members settle, then
policy applies that reason under the normal priority rules.

The all-settled result is deterministic:

- all members succeed: close the Wave as `completed`;
- at least one member succeeds: close it as `partial` and evaluate only
  successful reports in participant order;
- no member succeeds because execution failed or expired: close it as `failed`
  and enter `waiting_human` rather than inventing progress;
- every member is canceled by an immediate user stop: close it as `canceled`
  and keep the Discussion terminally `canceled`.

A finalization Wave contains only the first eligible Reviewer, or the first
eligible participant when no Reviewer remains. The Reviewer may already have
contributed in the preceding ordinary parallel Wave; only the finalization Wave
itself is single-member.

The MVP Progress Evaluator combines deterministic facts and Agent assessments.
It writes one aggregate version per closed Wave. The standalone semantic
contract is not consumed on this path. Claimed `newEvidenceRefs` remain on the
Turn and in the claimed Progress union, but only Message, Run, Artifact,
Result, Memory or Discussion records resolved in the exact Room and Task enter
the verified union or count as new evidence. Missing and cross-scope claims do
not fail a reply and cannot reset plateau; legacy snapshots start with an empty
verified union rather than promoting historic strings.

Plateau detection compares Wave aggregates, not callback order. In addition to
exact normalized reply hashes, it conservatively treats long, similarly sized
Unicode near copies as repetition using local character-bigram overlap. Each
Wave compares only the ten newest accepted earlier replies plus earlier current
members in frozen order. Quorum-excluded and supplemental late replies are not
inputs. A typical plateau has no newly resolved important question, newly
verified evidence, changed decision, reduced disagreement or lexically novel
accepted reply across consecutive Waves.

A plateau with no important unresolved issue may finalize automatically only
when any required Reviewer approval is current. A plateau with a high-priority
unresolved issue or missing required approval moves to `waiting_human` and
offers a strategy or participant change; it must not claim success silently.
User-requested finalization and hard-budget termination remain separate stop
boundaries and do not claim policy satisfaction.

## Discussion Budget

Budget separates logical coordination from committed execution capacity:

```text
logical Waves + committed member execution slots + elapsed duration
```

For each ordinary Wave, closure advances the compatibility field `turnsUsed`
once and `agentRunsUsed` by the persisted expected-member count. The latter is a
committed execution-slot counter, not proof that every slot started a physical
Runtime process. Lease and hard boundaries use logical Wave usage and elapsed
duration. Two planned members in one Wave are one policy round and two committed
execution slots. Token and monetary-cost accounting is removed under ADR-0043.
Old persisted budgets are projected using only supported fields; new budget
events leave legacy nullable token/cost columns unused. Historical rows and
reviewed benchmark evidence are retained without rewriting them.

The server grants a bounded lease instead of promising a fixed number of Waves.
At lease exhaustion it may renew within the automatic boundary. Crossing a
soft boundary moves to `awaiting_extension`; crossing a hard boundary stops new
ordinary Waves.

Finalization has a separate reserve that ordinary Waves cannot consume. This
allows a hard-budget stop to still produce the best available conclusion,
unresolved issues, and evidence references.

## Policy and Decision

Policy is resolved in descending authority:

```text
Team safety limits
  -> Room policy
  -> Discussion template
  -> permitted user options
```

Templates may define brainstorming, architecture review, debate, or
implementation completion. Reviewer approval applies only when required by the
resolved policy.

The authoritative action is one of:

- `continue` — atomically plan the next eligible Wave;
- `wait_human` — preserve state until required input arrives;
- `pause` — stop scheduling without canceling the transcript;
- `finalize` — produce the configured terminal output;
- `cancel` — interrupt all active members when possible;
- `terminate` — stop because a hard policy boundary was reached.

Final output is independent: `none`, `summary`, `final_answer`, `artifact`,
`decision_record`, or `unresolved_issues`. Decision priority is deterministic:
immediate user cancellation; security and hard-budget gates; required human
input; user finish; completion; plateau; soft-budget extension; continue.

## State Machine

```text
active
  |-- stop after Wave -----> stop_requested --+
  |-- input required ------> waiting_human ----+--> active
  |-- lease not extended --> awaiting_extension+
  |-- operator pause ------> paused -----------+
  |-- finish decision -----> finalizing -------> completed
  |-- immediate stop ------> canceled
  `-- hard boundary -------> finalizing -------> terminated
```

State and reason are separate. Reasons include `goal_satisfied`,
`user_requested_finish`, `discussion_plateau`, `soft_budget_exhausted`,
`hard_budget_exhausted`, `policy_violation`, and `runtime_failure`.

## Runtime Context

Every Wave member receives a bounded, named context containing the goal,
speaker identity and Discussion role, participant roster, target audience,
progress snapshot with verified evidence, important unresolved questions,
recent transcript with concrete Message IDs,
checkpoint summary, remaining lease, exact current Task and complete optional
assessment guidance. Members in one ordinary Wave receive the same frozen
transcript anchor and cannot see peer replies from that Wave.

When an ordinary Wave settles, the server idempotently appends a deterministic
`wave_result` system Message whose ID is derived from the Wave ID. Its member
status lines use frozen participant order, and it becomes the next Wave's input
anchor. The next instruction separately reconstructs successful prior replies
in Wave/member ordinal order. Room Messages retain durable arrival order, so the
visible timeline may differ from evaluation and instruction order.

The server serializes this context into the Run instruction so existing managed
and pull adapters participate without a client rewrite. It first reserves the
current identity, Task, `Your Task`, assessment and structured finalization
rules, bounds goal and progress sections, then admits only the newest accepted
transcript lines that fit. The transcript remains limited to 24 Room Messages,
and any character-budget omission receives a visible truncation marker. The
whole instruction remains within 20,000 Unicode code points without splitting a
code point.

Managed adapters should emit structured assessments when supported. Generic or
manual participants may emit reply-only output; policy remains safe under that
capability downgrade. Codex and Generic CLI may append a final
`<agentroom-assessment>{...}</agentroom-assessment>` envelope. The Bridge removes
a valid envelope from the visible reply and sends it as optional assessment
data. The instruction names every supported optional field, requires justified
values and tells the designated Reviewer to report `reviewerApproved`
explicitly. Invalid or missing envelopes remain reply-only output.

MVP finalization persists summaries, final answers, decision records, and
unresolved issues as Messages. Selecting `artifact` asks the finalizer for a
message representation; binary Artifact transport remains owned by `FUT-004`.

### Structured Execution Proposal Finalization

`DISC-010` adds one bounded adapter only when the frozen output mode is
`decision_record`. The finalizer's visible conclusion remains the ordinary
Agent reply Message. A proposal is considered only when that Message ends with
exactly one final line of this form:

```text
<convenewire-plan-proposal>{"schemaVersion":"1.0",...}</convenewire-plan-proposal>
```

The JSON body must satisfy the closed shared `discussionPlanProposalDraft`
schema. It contains title, decision summary/items/questions, nodes, edges,
external inputs and policy. It cannot supply root Task identity, evidence
sources, source revisions, author, operation identity, approval or execution
state. The adapter never extracts a plan from prose, Markdown or a near-match.
Missing, duplicate, oversized, malformed, trailing or schema-invalid envelopes
leave the final Message intact and create no DecisionRecord or PlanProposal.

The Server binds the draft to the Discussion's exact top-level Task and adds
only two authoritative decision sources: the immutable final reply Message at
its Room sequence and the terminal Discussion at its aggregate version. The
author is `{ kind: "discussion", discussionId }`; the stable operation identity
is derived by the Server from the finalization Turn. All ordinary graph,
Task/Agent/repository reference, source-freeze and external-input validation
still applies. A structurally valid draft that fails any domain check creates no
plan and cannot prevent the Discussion and visible conclusion from finishing.

Final Discussion closure and valid draft persistence share one immediate
transaction. A crash cannot retain only one side. Reconciliation after restart
recomputes the same operation and returns the one existing draft rather than
creating another. The resulting plan remains `draft`: finalization cannot
approve it, compile child Tasks, dispatch Runs, review Results, verify code,
integrate repositories, enlarge budgets or grant local Runtime authority.

`DISC-010` is implemented as this exact adapter. The finalizer instruction
names the closed envelope without granting source or operation fields. Central
parses only the singular bounded final line, closes the finalization Wave and
Discussion in the same immediate transaction used to retain a valid draft, and
reconciles the stable Turn-derived operation after restart. Focused physical
SQLite tests prove the final Message bytes remain unchanged, only the terminal
Discussion and final Message are frozen, approval/compiled-node counts stay at
zero, an injected Decision insert failure rolls closure back, and recovery
retains exactly one draft. Missing and domain-invalid envelopes still complete
the Discussion with no plan.

## User Experience

The Room uses one composer. Two to five distinct structured Agent Mentions
create a Discussion; the body becomes its goal. The root Message retains those
Mentions, but no independent fan-out bypasses Discussion control. There is no
separate **Start Discussion** mode.

The Room shows a logical round without a hard-limit denominator. While a Wave
is active it shows barrier progress such as `1/2 已结束` and one state chip
per member Run; Agent jobs are not separate rounds. Replies appear immediately,
and finalization is a separate single-Agent phase.

Primary control is **Finish and generate conclusion**. Secondary controls are
**Stop after this round**, **Pause**, and **Stop immediately**. Finish,
stop-after-round, and pause take effect after the current Wave barrier;
immediate stop cancels every active member Run. At a soft boundary the UI
offers **Continue solving**, **Finish with current conclusion**, or **Adjust
goal**, without asking users to allocate internal rounds.

## Recovery and Security

- Persist a decision, Wave, and all member Turn intents atomically before Run
  creation or delivery.
- Persist and digest the selected/eligible member IDs, focused questions,
  required roles and focused limit with that Wave; recovery validates exact
  member order and never reselects a committed Wave.
- A Room has at most one non-terminal Discussion. Competing creation requests
  receive a conflict.
- Each member Run uses its member `turnId` as a unique `orchestrationKey`.
  Reconciliation first binds an existing keyed Run and creates one only when no
  keyed identity exists, without guessing from Message and Agent identity.
- Wave closure, one budget event, one progress projection, the authoritative
  decision, and any next Wave are aggregate-version fenced.
- The deterministic `wave_result` ID makes a crash after anchor append and
  before barrier closure idempotently retryable.
- `QA-010` reopens SQLite and rebuilds repositories at planned-member,
  partially settled barrier, and committed-next-Wave cut points. Stable
  `orchestrationKey` identities prevent duplicate execution.
- Only existing, enabled Agents from the Room's Team may be scheduled. Proposed
  evidence and Artifacts are authorized and validated before projection.
- Redaction runs before Discussion context leaves the central service.
- Immediate stop preserves committed Messages and records unknown Runtime
  outcomes where necessary.

## Verification and Tasks

Deterministic tests cover focused question/reporting/role selection, no-match
and migration compatibility, exact digest/order, current authority loss,
snapshot substitution and duplicate reopened recovery; callback permutations,
duplicate terminals, all-success, partial-success, all-failed, deadline,
`input_required`, cancel-all, early completion, lease renewal, boundary-aligned
user controls, stale decisions, plateau policies, Runtime capability downgrade,
deterministic anchors, participant-ordered bounded context, and three reopened-
SQLite recovery cut points. A live Codex-Pi run proves one parallel contribution
Wave and Reviewer finalization through the Go Bridge.

Sequential orchestration is tracked by `DISC-001` through `DISC-006`; parallel
Wave delivery, presentation, and acceptance are completed by `DISC-007`,
`WEB-020`, and `QA-010`. Lifecycle service extraction is tracked by `DISC-008`
and `DISC-009`; structured finalization-to-plan delivery is completed by
`DISC-010`, and focused participant selection by `DISC-011`, in
`docs/TASKS.md`.
