# Module Architecture Index

This directory turns the v0.2 architecture baseline into implementation-sized
modules. The baseline defines product boundaries; these documents define module
ownership, interfaces, dependencies, failure behavior, and verification.

## Source-of-Truth Order

When documents disagree, use this order:

1. Accepted ADRs in `docs/adr/`;
2. `convenewire_network_design_v0.2.md`;
3. module documents in this directory;
4. `docs/TASKS.md` for delivery status, never for architecture;
5. code and generated API documentation.

An implementation change that alters a module contract must update its module
document and the task list in the same commit.

## Node-first evolution

[ADR-0065](../adr/0065-node-first-authority-model.md), tracked by GOV-044, is
Accepted. [ADR-0066](../adr/0066-local-node-delivery.md) defines the authorized
Local Node increment. Multi-Authority and Peer implementation remain deferred.

The deployment boundary composes the existing Hub, Web, Go Runtime and
SQLite. Team Authority owns collaboration writes; the Participant owns local
execution. Authority connectors share one execution core and stable local Agent
identity, with separately scoped contexts, credentials, grants and trust.

| Owning modules | Proposed boundary to review before implementation |
| --- | --- |
| CON, SEC, REG, ROOM | AuthorityRef, distinct Peer identity, Room credential ceiling, bilateral Export/Acceptance and revocation |
| BRG, ADP, WSP, REPO | Shared local Agent/resource arbitration, scoped Sessions and Participant-local Peer approval |
| DATA, RUN | Hosted versus Remote ownership, immutable execution identity, cancellation and content-free reconciliation |
| DISC, TASK, ART, EXEC | Preserve single-authority orchestration, Task isolation, exact evidence disclosure and governed execution |
| WEB, OPS, QA | Local Node lifecycle, identity/data upgrades, Space isolation and separately evidenced milestone acceptance |

The ADR holds the invariants, permission/ownership matrices, recovery states,
compatibility relationships and open decisions. [TASKS.md](../TASKS.md) remains
the only delivery checklist. Only Milestone A tasks are started by this decision.

## Dependency Flow

```text

├── DATA
├── SEC
├── ROOM
├── REG
└── BRG
    └── ADP (managed local Runtime)

DATA + SEC ── ADP (optional Central Hosted model)

ROOM + REG + BRG + DATA
          ├── WSP
          │   └── ART
          ├── TASK ← ART
          │   └── RUN
          └── RUN
              ├── MCP
              ├── DISC
              │   └── WEB
              └── WEB

OPS composes the released central topology; QA verifies every layer.
```

Dependencies describe contract order, not necessarily delivery order. Fake
implementations may stand in for an unfinished dependency during a milestone.

## Server Composition Boundary

`apps/server/src/app.ts` is the Server composition root. It opens the database,
constructs shared repositories and services, installs process-wide hooks, owns
startup recovery and timers, and passes an explicit `ServerRouteContext` to
feature route registrars under `apps/server/src/http/`. Route registrars may
bind HTTP, WebSocket, or MCP transport behavior for their feature, but they do
not construct repositories, services, timers, or other cross-module state.
Shared request parsing and cookie helpers remain transport utilities and own no
domain state.

This boundary keeps dependency construction and lifecycle authority visible in
one place while allowing Auth, Team/Room, Registry, Message, Task, Discussion,
Run, Bridge, MCP, and system routes to evolve behind their existing public
contracts. Moving behavior between registrars does not change the state owner
listed in the module map.

ADR-0026 adds Hosted profile/security routes and an in-process model adapter
behind this same composition root. It does not add a second Server process or
give route registrars direct provider, credential, repository, timer, or
recovery ownership.

## Standard Module Document

ADR-0036 adds governed software-team execution incrementally, and ADR-0039
fixes its Client-owned Repository boundary. Execution calls existing
Task/Run/Result ports; it does not own mirrored terminal state. Repository and
Git execution stay on the Client/Bridge; Central keeps only governed requests,
evidence and receipts. The retained Remote Evidence provider adapter is an
optional extension, not a new central shell or a Core dependency. Dependencies
describe contracts; composition-root callbacks connect scheduling without
circular process ownership.

Every module document contains:

- purpose and ownership;
- responsibilities and explicit exclusions;
- public contracts;
- state and main flows;
- failure and security behavior;
- tests and acceptance;
- dependencies and task IDs.

Do not add a new large module without updating this index and
`docs/TASKS.md`.
